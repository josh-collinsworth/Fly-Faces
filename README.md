##Fly Faces

This is a game created in React to help me and my coworkers get to know each other better. It works by querying the WordPress REST API for data and working with it in React to create a game with multiple options of how to play.

###To do: 

* Add a reload warning (since reloading starts over)
* Find a better solution for starting a new game than just reloading
* Soooo much code removal (comments especially) and refactoring
* Maybe add a "how to play" instructions sheet with more details on modes, etc.
* Minor usability improvements (button jumps on skips, font color/background)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
