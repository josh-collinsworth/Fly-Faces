## Fly Faces

This is a game created in React to help me and my coworkers get to know each other better. It works by querying the WordPress REST API for data and working with it in React to create a game with multiple options of how to play.

### To do:

* Find a better solution for starting a new game than just reloading (maybe offer to keep the same mode)
* Maybe add a "how to play" instructions sheet with more details on modes, etc.
* Minor usability improvements (better font color handling when colors are randomized)
* General refactoring (the randomness could be a lot less taxing with better code)
* Eventually maybe add more modes/options. A race mode with a timer would be pretty cool.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
